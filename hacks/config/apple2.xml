Simulates an original Apple ][ Plus computer in all its 1979 glory.  It
also reproduces the appearance of display on a color television set of
the period.

In "Basic Programming Mode", a simulated user types in a BASIC program
and runs it.  In "Text Mode", it displays the output of a program, or
the contents of a file or URL.  In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random
images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][
display hardware.  (Six available colors in hi-res mode!)

This program is also a fully-functional VT100 emulator!  Run it as an
application instead of as a screen saver and you can use it as a
terminal.
